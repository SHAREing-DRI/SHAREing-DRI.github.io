  summary: "This group studies and gathers performance assessment methodologies. The collected expertise helps SHAREing’s assessments, but the group also works towards a unique SHAREing approach which can be rolled out at multiple compute centres in the UK. For this, it has to assess shortcomings of existing methodologies, i.e. commission user studies, and work closely together with the training work packages whenever missing assessment skills are identified."
