CIUK is one of the UK's premier conferences for High-Performance Computing and associated research, showcasing hardware, software, innovations, and community developments.

The theme in 2025 was “Computing Unites”, with sessions on energy-efficient computing, community building, cybersecurity, and more. Early career researchers and students were also welcome to participate in the CIUK Cluster Challenge and poster competition.
