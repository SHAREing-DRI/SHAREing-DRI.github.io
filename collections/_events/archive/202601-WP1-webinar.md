## Event information

SHAREing is organising an afternoon webinar to present and discuss performance assessments. A core component of SHAREing's vision is to establish a performance assessment service, however, to achieve this aim we must understand what a performance assessment can be.

This webinar brings together members of SHAREing and external collaborators to present the findings of performance assessments they have been involved in. Through this webinar, we hope to gain a better understanding of what a performance assessment should include and how this builds into a service.
