**Correctness and Debugging Workshop Series**

Within modern, complex software landscapes, developers typically spend a significant proportion of their time on debugging. Studies estimate that more time is required to find bugs than to write actual code. Finding bugs and delivering correct(er) code becomes more difficult with modern HPC systems which offer unprecedented concurrency: The systems become heterogeneous, i.e. process code differently, bugs become non-deterministic. Different programming models are often used in combination, complicating questions of correctness and debugging further.

This workshop series gives a hand-on introduction to modern tools for debugging and correctness checking. It consists of the following events.
