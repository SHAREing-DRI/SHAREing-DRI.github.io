## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 2.3](/workpackages/workpackage-2/).

The task number is 027.

## Summary

The recent boom in AI is enabled and facilitated by the HPC facilities
that AI is trained and deployed on.  However traditional HPC
facilities use very little operational AI internally, and RTPs
generally have little to no AI training.

This project should investigate and summarise to what extent AI is being
used internally for cluster management around the globe, and identify
areas where AI could be of use.  In particular it should focus on open
source self-hosted solutions which RTP staff can install, operate,
manage and understand, rather than black box solutions.

It should also seek to deploy a prototype AI assistant monitoring system
logs and emails to identify likely problems.  This will take a simple
approach and by RTP-led to ensure that such a system is both useful
and maintainable.  However it is not expected to take any actions,
rather it will offer advice and prepare scripts that should be run
after human oversight and intervention.

The limitations and risks of AI capabilities should also be
documented, and guidance for safe deployment developed.  Allowance for
institutional differences and restrictions should also be made, and
open source solutions should be favoured.

## Approach

A landscape survey should be carried out into current use of AI in HPC
infrastructure (i.e. used to manage and monitor the infrastructure),
and outputs documented online.

It will also identify areas of system management where AI could be of
potential use, and suggest open source solutions for each of these.

A key component of this project should be the development of a framework
for an open source AI assistant used to monitor system logs and
emails.  By using open source components, such as Ollama, and by
integrating logging facilities in the correct way, the project will
seek to deliver a workable solution able to identify faults and
problems, and also describe a framework which can be used for other
systems and input data.

Results should be presented at major UK conferences, including HPC Days.


## Outputs

Outputs should include an online landscape review hosted in the SHAREing
website, suggestions for applicability of AI, and a prototype
AI-assisted management tool, plus a framework for implementation of
further aids.
