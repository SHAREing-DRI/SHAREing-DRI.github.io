## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 3.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 016.

## Description

Multiple DRI and ExCALIBUR projects have made a contribution to the professional skills training landscape. 
However, it is not clear to which degree these skills are relevant to an accelerate computing hub.

- Map existing provision: Survey current professional skills training available to RTPs across universities, research councils,
partner organisations, and relevant industry programmes.
- Identify strengths and gaps: Analyse the landscape to highlight
strong areas, underserved competencies, and overlaps in
existing training.
- Guide future development: Provide recommendations to
ensure SHAREing training avoids duplication and focuses on
unmet needs to complement existing resources.

The task might be combined with the organisation of events.
Alternatively, people tackling this task might want to request funds to participate in relevant events.

## Outcomes

- Publish findings on the SHAREing webpage.
