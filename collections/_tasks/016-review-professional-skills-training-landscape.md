## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 3.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 016.

## Description

Before developing new training resources under WP3.3 and WP3.4, it is important to 
understand the current provision of professional skills training across research 
institutions and partner organisations. This review will establish a baseline, identify 
existing gaps, and ensure that SHAREing complements rather than duplicates other 
initiatives.
The Task will conduct a survey of professional skills training currently available to RTPS, 
covering both formal programmes (e.g. accredited project management courses, 
institutional training pathways) and informal opportunities (e.g. workshops, summer 
schools, mentoring schemes). The scope will include training offered within 
universities, research councils, and partner organisations such as DiRAC and CoSeC, 
as well as examples from industry where relevant.
The findings will provide a structured view of the professional skills training landscape, 
highlighting areas of strength, under-served competencies, and opportunities for 
alignment with SHAREing’s objectives. This baseline will also inform the design of new 
training content and formats in later Tasks.


## Outcomes

- A structured survey of existing professional skills training relevant to RTPs across institutions and organisations in the UK.
- A summary of strengths, gaps, and overlaps in current provision.
- Recommendations for how SHAREing training should avoid duplication and address unmet needs.
