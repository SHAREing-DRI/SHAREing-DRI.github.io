## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.2](/workpackages/workpackage-1).
The task number is 006.


## Description

Performance analysis is almost by definition a key component of High-Performance 
Computing (HPC) and so many different HPC centres and communities have some 
formal or informal methods for quantifying and analysing performance. The Tasks: WP1.2 
[006](tasks/008_document-DiRAC/), [007](/tasks/007_features-of-the-POP/) and [008](/tasks/007_supercomputing_wales/) play a key role in collating preexisting expertise from different HPC 
communities of how performance analysis assessments are currently conducted. 

We have been informed that DiRAC already have conducted ‘in house’ performance 
analyses though potentially without a formalised methodology or service and is hence 
not documented or hosted anywhere public. However, we have been informed that 
Simon Burbidge appears to be the main point of contact for this work.
We propose that a member of SHAREing could interview Simon (and other performanceoriented members of DiRAC), to document DiRAC’s current methods for current 
performance assessments including:

1. How do they initialise this performance assessment? For example, what 
information is required from the user/developer - this has links to [WP1.1 Task 002](/tasks/002_code_requirements/)
2. Do they work from some informal performance methodology or standards?
3. How do they incorporate tools into this methodology? And which tools are they 
using?
4. What criteria do they have for establishing whether a code would benefit from 
porting to GPUs? This is crucial for understanding how performance assessments 
can be used in targeting particular hardware.

## Outcomes

• A documented summary of the DiRAC performance analysis methods.<br>
• By offering to document this on behalf of DiRAC, it is possible that, with the 
consent of DiRAC members, this could lead to a joint manuscript between 
DiRAC and SHAREing members
