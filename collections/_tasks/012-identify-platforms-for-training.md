## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 2.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 2.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 012.


## Description

A key aspect of SHAREing’s work is to act as a hub for training opportunities, and to 
develop new training that can fill the gaps. Given that these resources will be developed 
during the project, it is vital that they remain available past the end of the project, to 
avoid the window of availability being vanishingly small.
While training material can be hosted in any number of venues (e.g. GitHub Pages, as is 
done for Carpentries material; YouTube for video resources; Zenodo; etc.), platforms for 
curating collections of training resources from diverse sources are less well-explored. 
An example of a class of such platforms would be Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), 
such as Moodle.
The aim of this mini-project is to search out platforms that can host SHAREing’s hub 
past the end of the project, indefinitely, and for no ongoing cost. Options may include 
platforms open to all, and platforms hosted by project partners (for example, DiRAC Training Academy, 
CoSeC).


## Outcomes


- A review of at least three available platforms, including.
- A direct comparison of available features in each.
- A discussion of advantages and disadvantages of each option.
