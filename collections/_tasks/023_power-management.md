## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.1](/workpackages/workpackage-1/).

The task number is 023.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Summary

As HPC systems become more power hungry, and as grid provision becomes
more variable, it is increasingly important to be able to moderate HPC
power demand in response to supply, electricity cost and grid carbon
intensity.

This project invites proposals to investigate simple methods for dynamic power
capping, consider performance impacts, and to study the degree of control
achievable from a system perspective.  Options to dynamically control
power based on inputs from external sources (e.g. carbon intensity)
should be developed.

The findings should be written up and presented at conferences and
workshops.

## Approach + methodology

Multiple techniques to control node power consumption within large
scale computing systems should be documented and explored, including
OS-based scheduling, batch system management and BIOS control.  The
change in power consumption when running various codes, as well as the
total energy to complete a workflow should be considered.

Additionally, a study of whole system consumption and embodied carbon
should be included in the proposals to ensure that a holistic approach
is taken.

A number of community test codes should be explored, investigating how
dynamic power control affects overall performance and
"time-to-science".  Impacts on performance should be categorised, and
recipes for whole-system approaches should be developed allowing
adjustment of system power consumption whilst in production.

Inputs from external sources should be captured, and algorithms
developed to control power in response to these.

The findings will be written up and presented on a website and at
conferences.

This project has several achievable goals which should not present any
risk to delivery.  There are then stretch goals, including
investigation of additional codes, interaction with real HPC systmes,
more investigation into different power control methods, etc, which
should be delivered if achievable, and the risks of attempting these
should be considered.

This project facilitates several learning opportunities for the RTPs
involved in the final projects, including investigation into power
control techniques, algorithms, and impact of external factors.

## Outputs

Documentation for the RTP community on the SHAREing website and
presentation at workshops and events should be provided.

A working prototype system capable of reducing power demand in response to
carbon intensity or grid pricing should be delivered if feasible, and
it is hoped that there will be scope to place such a system into
production, given necessary approvals.
