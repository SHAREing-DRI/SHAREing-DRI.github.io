## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 2.3](/workpackages/workpackage-2/).

The task number is 024.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Description

Openstack is an open source cloud computing platform widely used to
deploy infrastructure-as-a-service.  It is also suitable for managing
bare metal provisioning of HPC systems, and as such used by Durham and
Cambridge.

However, it comes with a steep learning curve, high complexity and a
rapidly changing environment, and involves many newer concepts that
RTPs in large-scale compute may traditionally be unfamiliar with,
including Ansible and Kubernetes.

The high complexity of OpenStack is challenging, and the underlying
software stack changes rapidly, often losing backwards compatibility.
Therefore, upgrades can be fraught.

This project seeks proposals to document community OpenStack journeys
by institutions and sites that have gone down this route, delivering
honest user stories detailing the routes taken, methods used and lived
experience.

Information, description and documentation about system upgrades
should also be delivered, and ideally this information should be
captured during an ongoing, real system upgrade, so that details,
warts-and-all, can be captured and documented.

This proposal will aid RTP team "upskilling" as significant
understanding will be required to sort through installation notes,
configuration files and other sources.

A key output will be documentation to advise other RTPs on how
upgrades can be effectively performed on live systems.

## Approach and methodology

This project should document OpenStack install and configuration
procedures, drawing on configuration from real systems.

It should also seek to document the process of a live OpenStack upgrade,
which is often fraught with problems, and highly complex, with
significant investment in time required to understand potential
sticking points.

Ongoing live documentation and methodology should be captured, and a
chronological account published online.  Additionally, the steps taken
should be developed into a guide, providing the principles,
though it is noted that each upgrade will be different and experience
different problems.

This experience will deliver significant OpenStack on-the-job training
to RTPs.


## Outputs

Outputs include documentation on the SHAREing website on how to
complete upgrades, a chronological upgrade account, details of the RTP
experience, and increased RTP skills.
