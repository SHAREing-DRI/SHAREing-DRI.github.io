## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.3](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 009.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Description

SHAREing requires a portal where all the available testbeds are enlisted.
We envisage a page where compute centres can add their own systems, and users can search for particular system characteristics.
In the ideal case, the meta information on the portal can be extended, such that the information as identified in 
<a href="https://shareing-dri.github.io/tasks/001-system-overview-criteria/">Task 0001</a> can be added and searched.


## Outcomes

- [Portal to register and search new hardware (testbeds)][portal].

This task is WiP. 

[portal]: /hpc-testbeds/
