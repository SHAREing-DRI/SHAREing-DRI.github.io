## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.1](/about/workinggroups).


<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Description

Supercomputing Wales (SCW) has a long-standing record of software performance
characterisation featuring staff at both Hub Sites – Cardiff and Swansea. Staff at Cardiff have built
on the original Architecture Comparison Exercise (ACE [1]), a UK based initiative aimed at
developing a qualitative methodology for understanding and predicting the performance of a
series of large-scale HPC applications across a spectrum of massively-parallel HPC
architectures. This has evolved into the regular CIUK presentations focused on the performance
analysis of a variety of multi-core high-end cluster systems from Intel and AMD.
Swansea University developed the BSMBench benchmark designed to evaluate supercomputers,
a code that transitioned into Sombrero, that became part of the UKRI ExCALIBUR benchmarking
suite and has in fact provided a template for developing other benchmarks. Swansea also
pioneered the use of AccelerateAI, a GPU compute cluster designed to enable high-speed AI/ML
computations, available to all SCW institutions.

## Outcomes

- Document existing work on ‘software performance characterisation’ from Supercomputing Wales.
= Publish summmary on SHAREing webpage.
