## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 2.3](/workpackages/workpackage-2/).

The task number is 026.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Summary

Cyber security is of key concern for large scale and accelerated
compute facilities.  However, security teams are often siloed and have
vastly different ranges of knowledge and experience.

This project seeks to enable multiple DRI teams to link up for
security purposes and share knowledge, understanding, information and
fixes between these teams.

It can provide funding for initial effort to facilitate weekly team
member meetings for a set period of time, beyond which it is hoped
that this linkage will become self sustaining.

It should provide RTP experience in managing a cross-provider team, and
in collaboration with other team members.  It could be modelled on the IRIS
security team membership which is comprised of multiple DRI teams
within the STFC remit.

This team meeting will be opened up to other DRI providers to join.

A key output should be the e-learning content that is delivered by these
meetings, including lists of security vulnerabilities and events
relevant for HPC.

## Approach

A number of separate DRI teams should be approached to explore
willingness to join a weekly security session.  These sessions are
likely to be short, no more than 30 minutes, unless there is a severe
ongoing critical incident

A weekly timeslot should be arranged where current known security
vulnerabilities will be discussed.  Experience with fixes will be
shared.  Insight into known hacks or security failures around the UK
will also be discussed.  The timeslot will generally be kept brief.
However, when there are significant vulnerabilities to discussed,
meeting duration can be increased.  Discussion should be open and
honest, aiming to encourage good behaviour 

Brief minutes from meetings should be kept.

The team setup, regular meeting agenda and operational parameters should
be documented and shared with the DRI community via an online site.
Invitation to join the meeting should be shared around the DRI
community.

This project will last for 6 months, to allow time for meetings to
take shape, after which it is hoped they will be self-sustaining.  It
should be attended by up to 3 team members from each DRI facility.


## Outputs

Outputs include more secure systems, increase in RTP skills, increase
in RTP awareness, and a more joined up cyber security eco system
within the DRI.

However, the key output will be a regularly updated web presence on the SHAREing webpages containing e-learning content for RTPs covering the knowledge gained at the meetings, including lists of security vulnerabilities and security events relevant for HPC.
