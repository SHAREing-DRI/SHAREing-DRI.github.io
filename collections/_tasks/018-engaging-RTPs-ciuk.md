## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 3.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 018.


## Description

This task centres on the design and delivery of a dedicated session at CIUK 
2025, aimed at engaging Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) in a meaningful 
conversation about professional skills. CIUK provides a unique opportunity to reach a 
wide audience of technical staff working at the intersection of research and 
infrastructure, making it an ideal platform to raise awareness and foster dialogue 
around the skills that underpin effective collaboration, leadership, and career 
progression.
The session will be crafted to go beyond traditional presentations, incorporating 
interactive elements that invite RTPs to reflect on their own experiences and contribute 
to shaping a shared understanding of professional skills. The event will also serve as a 
space to share early insights from the consortium’s work on defining professional skills, 
helping to validate and refine this emerging framework through direct input from the 
community.
The feedback and engagement generated will inform future training design and 
communications, ensuring that professional development offerings are aligned with the 
real needs and aspirations of RTPs.


## Outcomes

- A  well-attended and interactive session at CIUK 2025 that engages RTPs in  meaningful dialogue about professional skills.
- A summary report capturing participant feedback, insights, and recommendations for future training and engagement strategies.
- Recommendations for how SHAREing can use events like CIUK to embed and  promote professional skills development across the consortium.
