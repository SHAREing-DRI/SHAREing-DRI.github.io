## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.1](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 003.

## Description

A GPU implantation of interactions is being developed by the Celeritas team, based at the
Oak Ridge laboratory in the US in collaboration with colleagues at Warwick Universities. A
recent review conducted at CERN demonstrated a good physics performance of this
implementation and an initial integration with the ATLAS experiment software.
The goal of this mini-project is to use the existing Celeritas code implementation to 

1. assess the performance of the code, via the use of profilers to identify potential bottleneck, 
2. assess the impact of the use of single vs double precision floating points, 
3. assess the ability to run code on AMD GPUs compared to the original CUDA implementation.


## Outcomes

- Report on lessons learned on all three aspects on SHAREing's webpages

This project has now finished. The outcomes can be found [in a report on the SHAREing webpage](/performance-assessment/2025-sheffield).
