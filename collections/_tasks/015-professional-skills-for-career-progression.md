## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 3.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 015.


## Description

The consortium has the impression that the term professional skills for RTPs is not cearly defined.
The ambition behind this task is to tackle this fundamental challenge and hence to identify the clear potential audiences of SHAREing.

- Develop a clear, tailored definition of “professional skils” relevant to Research Technical Professionals, showing how they connect to technical roles and career progression.
- Collect and present case studies of RTPs who have advanced their careers or improved institutional/industry engagement through professional skills training;
- Provide actionable recommendations: Compare with industry practices and suggest how SHAREing can embed professional skills into future training resources to ensure uptake and relevance.

The task might be combined with the organisation of events.
Alternatively, people tackling this task might want to request funds to participate in relevant events.


## Outcomes

- Publish findings on the SHAREing webpage.
