The ambition behind this task is to tackle this fundamental challenge and hence to identify the clear potential audiences of SHAREing.

- Develop a clear, tailored definition of “professional skils” relevant to Research Technical Professionals, showing how they connect to technical roles and career progression.
- Collect and present case studies of RTPs who have advanced their careers or improved institutional/industry engagement through professional skills training;
- Provide actionable recommendations: Compare with industry practices and suggest how SHAREing can embed professional skills into future training resources to ensure uptake and relevance.

## Outcomes

- Publish findings on the SHAREing webpage.
