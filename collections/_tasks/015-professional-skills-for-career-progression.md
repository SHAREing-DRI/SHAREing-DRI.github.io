## Fit to programme
This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/workpackages/workpackage-3).

The task number is 015.


## Description

Professional skills are often undervalued or misunderstood by Research Technical 
Professionals (RTPs), who may see them as unrelated to their technical expertise or 
beyond their role. However, these skills—such as procurement, supplier engagement, 
project management, and cross-team coordination—are not only relevant but essential 
for career progression and for enabling RTPs to contribute meaningfully to institutional 
and industry partnerships.
This mini-project will establish a clear, working definition of “professional skills” tailored 
specifically to RTPs, grounded in the realities of technical research roles. It will explore 
how these skills are developed through technical work and how they empower RTPs to 
engage effectively with suppliers, funders, and collaborators.
To build engagement and demonstrate impact, the project will collect and present case 
studies and success stories from RTPs who have benefitted from professional skills 
training. It will also compare practices with industry, where structured approaches to 
project management and supplier engagement are standard, to highlight transferable 
models.


## Outcomes

- A published definition of professional skills for RTPs.
- A set of at least three case studies from RTPs demonstrating how professional  skills training has supported career progression and institutional engagement.
- Recommendations for how SHAREing can embed and communicate professional skills within future training resources to maximise relevance and uptake
