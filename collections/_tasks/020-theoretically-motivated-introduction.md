## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 2.3](workpackages/workpackage-2/).

The task number is 020.


## Description

There exists a wealth of technical training on how to use a specific tool or piece of technology for performance analysis or optimisation. However, each is focused on its single piece of technology, and so for a learner—for example, a researcher or new RSE—who does not already have a full and detailed grasp of the fundamentals, it will leave them with patchy knowledge that is difficult to apply more broadly.
The aim of this Task is an introductory guide to the basics of how to start formulating the right questions when performing performance analysis or optimisation. While grounding in the theory, this should still be practical, with a learning-by-doing approach, based on structured exercises showing optimisation in action. It should also incorporate a glossary, to allow those with preexisting knowledge from other contexts to connect it with the concepts being discussed in the training.
The content to be incorporated into this material likely already exists, but in forms not easily accessible—for example, it will have significant overlap with some first-year computer science courses. It is acceptable (and desirable) to adapt existing material into a suitable form for this Task; de novo material is not a requirement.



## Outcomes

- A package of training material that teaches the fundamentals of the theory of performance analysis and optimisation via structured exercises and examples, and provides a glossary of common/standard terminology for discussions of performance
- The training package must be openly licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY)
- The training should be delivered to a test audience (online or in person) before completion
- The training package should make use of a standard lesson template such as The Carpentries Workbench
