## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.3](/workpackages/workpackage-1/).

The task number is 028.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Description
Hardware testbed facilities are often not well advertised, and unknown
to all but a few users.  However, many of these are key national
resources providing early access to new and novel technologies.  These
high tech components are often of general interest to the Interested
Public, and to researchers and academics.

This project should develop outreach and promotional materials for
testbed facilities to help raise awareness and explain what they do and
how the UK can benefit from them.

This will give RTPs from across the UK an overview of the testbeds, and
enable them to offer appropriate advice to their supported research
communities who may require access to these technologies.

## Approach

Multiple outreach materials should be developed as part of this project.
Prototype tour guide materials should be developed, allowing
visitors to the testbeds to scan QR codes and view information about some
of the technologies.  Full online explanations should also be provided.

A deck of powerpoint slides should be developed to explore each testbed
facilities.

Promotional goods such as leaflets, mugs, socks, etc, should be
created as appropriate for use at national events such as HPC Days,
CIUK and DiRAC Day.

In developing these outreach materials, the RTPs involved will be able
to explore and make themselves aware of what is available, how it can
be used, and how appropriate it is for different scenarios.  This will
also aid their professional skills development.


## Outputs

Outputs include a outreach activities and materials in various
different formats each aimed at different audiences.  This can include
virtual lab tours, decks of slides, posters, promotional outreach
materials, etc.
