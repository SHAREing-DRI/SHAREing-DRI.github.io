## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.1](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 004.

<!-- I need some pictures and links -->

## Description

AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD are all-time classic in HPC benchmarking and workhorses on UK supercomputers.
The goals of this task are 

- demonstrate the performance improvements of the selected codes on GPUs compared, for example, to those seen on CPU systems;
- measure the impact on performance related to the availability of various GPU features.
- provide a rapid demonstration of SHAREing’s presence and capabilities to the RTP community, many of whom will be supporting these codes on their local clusters.



## Outcomes

- Technical report / white paper on the findings.
- Upload on the SHAREing webpage.
- Publication of findings at conference such as CIUK to both promote the lessons learned but also SHAREing.

This project has now finished. The outcomes can be found [in a report on the SHAREing webpage](/performance-assessment/2025-community-codes).
