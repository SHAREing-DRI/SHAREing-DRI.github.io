Using records retained from the time period, and having conversations with staff 
at the Supercomputing Wales partner institutions, we will document the approaches used for
software performance characterisation and improvement at the Supercomputing Wales
partner institutions, and prepare a document outlining them, including the principles
underpinning them and lessons learned from them.

## Description

Supercomputing Wales (SCW) has a long-standing record of software performance
characterisation featuring staff at both Hub Sites – Cardiff and Swansea. Staff at Cardiff have built
on the original Architecture Comparison Exercise (ACE [1]), a UK based initiative aimed at
developing a qualitative methodology for understanding and predicting the performance of a
series of large-scale HPC applications across a spectrum of massively-parallel HPC
architectures. This has evolved into the regular CIUK presentations focused on the performance
analysis of a variety of multi-core high-end cluster systems from Intel and AMD.
Swansea University developed the BSMBench benchmark designed to evaluate supercomputers,
a code that transitioned into Sombrero, that became part of the UKRI ExCALIBUR benchmarking
suite and has in fact provided a template for developing other benchmarks. Swansea also
pioneered the use of AccelerateAI, a GPU compute cluster designed to enable high-speed AI/ML
computations, available to all SCW institutions.
