## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.3](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 011.


## Description

Durham hosts a rather large <a href="https://durham.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwarelab/index.html">HPC Hardware Lab</a>.
However, it is not always straightforward to navigate it.
This task 

- cleans up the documentation;
- integrates the links into the <a href="https://shareing-dri.github.io/tasks/009_portal/">SHAREing testbed database</a>;
- ensures that there is some consistency with the criteria identified by <a href="https://shareing-dri.github.io/tasks/001-system-overview-criteria/">by Task 001</a>.

## Outcomes

- Clean-up of HPC Testbed pages.
- Content feeds into SHAREing's hardware portal.
