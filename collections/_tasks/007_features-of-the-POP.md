## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 1.2](/workpackages/workpackage-1/).
The task number is 007.

## Description

The European Union’s POP CoE (Productivity, Performance and Optimisation Centre of 
Excellence) is arguably the most established performance analysis service in Europe. The 
POP service is now in its third iteration, POP3 [1], which establishes the newest phase of:

1. The POP methodology – the in-house methodology for conducting a performance 
assessment
2. The POP metrics – a hierarchical set of performance metrics which aim to distil 
different performance features (e.g., load balance efficiency, communication 
efficiency, etc.) down to individual metrics
3. How the POP assessment service is designed to function
This Task aims to organise a training event delivered by POP members from the Barcelona 
Supercomputing Centre focused on the POP methodology. This aligns with [WP1.2 Tasks 006](/tasks/006_code_requirements/) and [007](/tasks/007_features-of-the-POP/) of bringing together preexisting performance analysis methodologies to 
understand the ‘state-of-play' for current standards.

Discussions with the POP representatives can naturally lead into discussions about how 
the POP service is operated, beyond details of the methodology. These discussions can 
then naturally link to [WP 1.1 (Task 002)](/tasks/002_code_requirements/).


## Outcomes

Organise an event with BSC members of POP <br><br>
• Collate a review from SHAREing members on this training to understand how a 
SHAREing performance analysis service may differ from that of POP <br>
• Collate a review from SHAREing members on this training to understand how a 
SHAREing performance analysis service may differ from that of POP
