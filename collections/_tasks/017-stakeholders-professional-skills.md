## Description

SHAREing wants to provide services to the higher education sector in the UK.
However, it also provides added value to SMEs, management, academics, and so forth.
There is no overview of all of these potential stakeholders.

- Map key stakeholders: Identify communities beyond RTPs—such as industry partners, senior staff, funders, and suppliers—who can articulate the value of professional skills in research settings.
- Gather external insights: Engage stakeholders to capture perspectives on critical competencies for collaboration, procurement, project coordination, and career progression.
- Inform training design: Provide recommendations to align SHAREing’s professional skills training with both academic and industry expectations, addressing current and emerging needs.


The task might be combined with the organisation of events.
Alternatively, people tackling this task might want to request funds to participate in relevant events.

## Outcomes

- Publish findings on the SHAREing webpage.
