## Fit to programme

This task has been identified by the working groups as part of the agenda behind [WP 3.3](/about/workinggroups) and [WP 3.4](/about/workinggroups).

The task number is 017.


## Description

Before developing new training resources under WP3.3 and WP3.4, it is important to 
RTPS themselves may not always recognise the importance of professional skills, which 
can make it difficult to assess needs directly. However, other communities—including 
industry partners, senior staff, funders, and suppliers—often have a clear perspective 
on the professional competencies required for effective collaboration and long-term 
career success.
This Task will map the key communities and stakeholders who understand the value of 
professional skills in research environments. By engaging with these groups, it will 
collect insights on the skills most critical for career development, procurement, 
supplier engagement, and project coordination. This approach will also highlight gaps 
that RTPS may not yet perceive, providing a more comprehensive understanding of 
training needs.
The findings will help shape future training content and ensure SHAREing resources are 
aligned with both academic and industry expectations, thereby strengthening their 
relevance and impact.


## Outcomes

- A mapped overview of key communities relevant to professional skills development (e.g. industry partners, senior staff, suppliers, funders).
- Collected insights from at least three stakeholder groups on professional skills needs.
- Recommendations on how SHAREing can tailor professional skills training to meet both current and emerging needs.
