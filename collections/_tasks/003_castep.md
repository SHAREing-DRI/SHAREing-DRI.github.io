## Description

CASTEP is one all-time classic in HPC benchmarking and one of the workhorses on UK supercomputers.
The goal of this task is to take CASTEP and to see if we can curate an example run that allows an independent team to
assess the code’s performance. On the long term, we’d expect any team submitting codes to SHAREing to provide us with such
an example run before we start. However, we initially have to create a few
examples ourselves, so people know what to expect. 
The idea here is that we take CASTEP and we distlill from there what minimal requirements of a benchmark have to be.

Obviously, the team taking up this task might want to go beyond the mere prep of benchmarking and actually do some benchmarking and analysis themselves. 
However, the core delivery of this task has to be a documentation of best practices on our webpages.


## Outcomes

- Brief experience report on the SHAREing webpages
- Recommendation checklist how people can prepare a benchmark before they actually hand it over to someone else for a performance analysis.

The recommendation checklist should be integrated into the [performance assessment workbook](/performance-assessment/guidebook.md) that we curate on SHAREing's webpage as living document.
However, it also should be distilled into a separate checklist that people can download/open on SHAREing's webpage and then work through.
