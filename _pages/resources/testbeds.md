## Context

UK researchers have access to a vast number of testbeds and machines where they can quickly get access and trial new codes or ideas.
Some of these machines have been procured through governmental grants such as the ExCALIBUR H&ES programme,
some universities open up their systems to UKRI-eligible colleagues,
and some commercial providers grant access to their systems in the Cloud, too. 
Unfortunately, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all the different opportunities. 
This page collects systems as well as some meta information such that it is easier for researchers to find the right system for the right purpose.

## University test clusters

- Durham hosts an [https://cosma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwarelab.html](HPC Hardware Lab @Durham). 

## Commercial portals

- NVIDIA offers the [https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/industries/higher-education-research/academic-grant-program/](NVIDIA Academic Grant Programâ€‹) which provides researchers with compute resources in the cloud.


## Disclaimer

This page is not yet complete, and we plan to work towards precise guidelines what should be documented per cluster on such an overview page.
SHAREing will also provide a mechanism in the near future to register new systems and ship example descriptions, so people have an idea what a good cluster description should look like.
