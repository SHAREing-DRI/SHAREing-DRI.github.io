title: "Performance assessment notebook"
---

As outlined in the [performance assessment guidebook](/assets/pdfs/perf_analysis_workbook_brief.pdf) SHAREing outlines a performance analysis methodology that is broken down into:
1. Preparation
2. High-level analysis
3. Lower-level analysis
Further details of the preparation can be found in the guidebook, and the lower-level analysis is in a very early stage of development. However, the high-level analysis is now at a stage in which it can be implemented and refined via user feedback. To get this process started we have created a Jupyter notebook to allow digital Research Technical Professionals (RTPs) to have a go at running some software through this relatively light touch assessment.

The GitHub repository hosting the notebook and dependencies is linked [here](https://github.com/SHAREing-DRI/high-level-notebook). Feedback for the notebook can be implemented via GitHub issues, or feel free to open a Pull Request for proposed features. The notebook has limited dependencies and is still in an early stage of development.
