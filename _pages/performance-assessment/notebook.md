As outlined in the [performance assessment
guidebook](/assets/pdfs/perf_analysis_workbook_brief.pdf) SHAREing outlines a
performance analysis methodology that is broken down into:

1. Preparation
2. High-level analysis
3. Lower-level analysis

Further details of the preparation can be found in the guidebook, and the
lower-level analysis is in a very early stage of development. However, the
high-level analysis is now at a stage in which it can be implemented and
refined via user feedback. To get this process started we have created a
**Jupyter notebook** to allow digital Research Technical Professionals (RTPs)
to have a go at running some software through this relatively light-touch
assessment.

The GitHub repository hosting the notebook and dependencies is linked
above. Feedback for the notebook can be implemented via GitHub issues, or feel
free to open a Pull Request for proposed features. The notebook has limited
dependencies and is still in an early stage of development.
