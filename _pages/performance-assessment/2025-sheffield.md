title: "Celeritas code assessment"
---


## Lead: Davide Costanzo, Sheffield University


## Description

A GPU implantation of interactions is being developed by the Celeritas team, based at the
Oak Ridge laboratory in the US in collaboration with colleagues at Warwick Universities. A
recent review conducted at CERN demonstrated a good physics performance of this
implementation and an initial integration with the ATLAS experiment software.
The goal of this mini-project is to use the existing Celeritas code implementation to 

1. assess the performance of the code, via the use of profilers to identify potential bottleneck, 
2. assess the impact of the use of single vs double precision floating points, 
3. assess the ability to run code on AMD GPUs compared to the original CUDA implementation.

## Outcomes

This project is currently running and there are no updates yet.
