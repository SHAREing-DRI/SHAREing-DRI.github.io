## Context

In 2025, we launched a series of events under the DRI's HAI-End project to
discuss with digital research professionals how they would address performance
analysis challenges given to them as a black-box.  Colleagues from industry and
tool vendors joined these meetings.  The HAI-End consortium collected all
outcomes and distilled them into a joint workbook, which we make available
through SHAREing.

## Versions

**This document is still in an early stage of development**

The current version of the performance analysis workbook is a brief
introduction to terminology, preparing for an assessment and SHAREing's
proposed high-level analysis.
