title: "Software Performance at Supercomputing Wales"
---

## Lead: Ed Bennett (Swansea University)

<!-- We should insert some pictures here, and we should also make the code names below hyperlinks -->

## Description

Using records retained from the time period, and having conversations with staff 
at the Supercomputing Wales partner institutions, we will document the approaches used for
software performance characterisation and improvement at the Supercomputing Wales
partner institutions, and prepare a document outlining them, including the principles
underpinning them and lessons learned from them.

## Outcomes

This project is currently running and there are no updates yet.
