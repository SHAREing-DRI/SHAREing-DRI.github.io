## Disclaimer

**Please note that this assessment service is under very early development.** 

We currently only conduct a very high-level assessment, and are using
submissions both to give software developers and researchers performance
reports, but also to refine and improve the assessment service itself.


## Benchmarking guidelines

To conduct a performance assessment, the service user should supply a
characteristic benchmark which captures features of the software into a smaller
application. To help with this please see
[here](/assets/pdfs/shareing-benchmark-guide.pdf) for our benchmarking
guidelines.

## Submission portal resources

As described above, all stages of this assessment service are still under
development and hence various aspects of this service will be extended and
adjusted through experience. Detailed descriptions of the assessment service
interface are documented in Appendix B of the [performance assessment
guidebook](/assets/pdfs/perf_analysis_workbook_brief.pdf).
