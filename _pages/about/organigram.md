# Working groups: how we identify what SHAREing should provide

SHAREing is organised into various working groups.
Each is responsible for a few work packages.
The groups meet sporadically and organise most of their work asynchronously via email and Slack conversations.
Their core job is to run scoping exercises: 
The groups brainstorm which type of activities SHAREing should fund in the future to accomplish its [about/vision](vision).
Eventually, the workgroups write and collect proposals for miniprojects worth a few months of RTP time that they want to see implemented to push the workpackage's agenda further, i.e. to fill SHAREing with content.
