# Working groups: how we identify what SHAREing should provide

SHAREing is organised into various working groups.
Each is responsible for a few work packages.
The groups meet sporadically and organise most of their work asynchronously via email and Slack conversations.
Their core job is to run scoping exercises: 
The groups brainstorm which type of activities SHAREing should fund in the future to accomplish its [about/vision](vision).
Eventually, the workgroups write and collect proposals for miniprojects worth a few months of RTP time that they want to see implemented to push the workpackage's agenda further, i.e. to fill SHAREing with content.

# How to get involved

At the moment (summer 2025), working groups are, be default, open to SHAREing consortium members only.
However, we plan to open up the groups to a wider audience and engage with the whole UK community on the long run.
Please contact the working group leads if you would like to participate at this early stage.
