# Working groups: how we identify what SHAREing should provide

SHAREing is organised into various working groups.
Each is responsible for a few work packages.
The groups meet sporadically and organise most of their work asynchronously via email and Slack conversations.
Their core job is to run scoping exercises: 
The groups brainstorm which type of activities SHAREing should fund in the future to accomplish its [about/vision](vision).
Eventually, the workgroups write and collect proposals for miniprojects worth a few months of RTP time that they want to see implemented to push the workpackage's agenda further, i.e. to fill SHAREing with content.

# Calls for miniprojects

Once the consortium has approved the miniprojects, SHAREing advertises these projects.
RTPs or groups of RTPs can bid to realise the miniprojects that SHAREing wants to commission in this phase.
Bids typically comprise and estimate of the arising cost, an envisaged time frame and all the realisation details how the team plans to meet the project's deliverables.

We expect regular calls for projects (3-4 per annum) and in each call there are many different projects on the table describing what the consortium wants to see delivered.
Obviously, there's usually quite some scope how this will be achieved.
Some projects deliver actual reports or training material, others comprise the organisation of events or questoinnaires, or general services to the community.

# How to get involved

At the moment (summer 2025), working groups are, be default, open to SHAREing consortium members only.
However, we plan to open up the groups to a wider audience and engage with the whole UK community on the long run.
Please contact the working group leads if you would like to participate at this early stage.
