title: "SHAREing's Working Groups"
---


Not all working groups have started their work yet. 
ThereforeThe working , the numbering might seem to be a little bit random.
Some working groups also tackle multiple workpackages from the original SHAREing proposal.
Hence, it might be reasonbale to ignore the workpackage numbers - they are for the consortium's internal planning primarily.


## Performance Assessments (WP 1.1)

**Lead: Martyn Guest (Cardiff)**

This working group identifies codes and systems that are accepted for SHAREing's performance assessment exercises.
The group ensures that SHAREing covers a wide variety of use cases and code and system characteristics.
It also studies the delivered assessments to identify overarching trends and issues of the sector.
People can submit their code for an assessment to SHAREing via a web portal (to be developed), but they might want to join the working group to co-steer the direction of the assessment exercises.  


## Assessment Methodology (WP 1.2)

**Lead: Thomas Flynn (Durham)**

This group studies and gathers performance assessment methodologies.
The collected expertise helps SHAREing's assessments, but the group also works towards a unique SHAREing approach which can be rolled out at multiple compute centres in the UK.
For this, it has to assess shortcomings of existing methodologies, i.e. commission user studies, and work closely together with the training work packages whenever missing assessment skills are identified.


## Testbeds (WP 1.3)

**Lead: Gokmen Kilic (Durham/DiRAC)**

This group discusses the status quo of testbeds in the UK.
We identify which information is to be collected and has to be consolidated, best practices in describing and assessing the testbeds, and the group also can make recommendations which testbeds they would like to see within the community to allow for faster progress in the field.



## Technical Training (WP 2.3/2.4)

**Lead: Ed Bennett (Swansea)**

This group reviews the status quo of technical training in the UK.
We identify shortcomings of existing training, missing ingredients, and best practices in the delivery of training.
The group identifies and commissions user questionnaires, the creation of new training material and training events.


## Professional Skills Training (WP 3.3/3.4)

**Lead: Eva Fernandez Amez (Durham)**

This group reviews the status quo of professional skills training for RTPs in the UK.
We identify shortcomings of existing training, missing ingredients, and best practices in the delivery of training.
The group identifies and commissions user questionnaires, the creation of new training material and training events.


## Industry outreach and dissemination (WP 4.2)

**Lead: Chris J. Howell (Durham)**

This group is responsible to review how SHAREing interacts with the public sector, SMEs and other consortia.
In close collaboration with other initiatives in the field, we commission join events, create bespoke outreach material, and collect feedback on the needs and wishes of non-academic communities, when it comes to accelerated computing.
